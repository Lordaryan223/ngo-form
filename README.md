Mini Healthcare Support Web App

This is a simple web app made for a healthcare NGO as a concept-level assignment.

The app has a basic form where patients or volunteers can enter their details and message.
Based on the message, the app automatically identifies the type of issue, sets a priority level, and shows a suggested action.

All submitted requests are saved locally and shown on a small dashboard so NGO staff can easily view and manage them.

Tech Used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Automation Idea:
Simple keyword-based logic to detect issues, assign priority, and suggest next steps.

Use-case:
Helps NGOs quickly understand requests and respond to urgent cases faster.
